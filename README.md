# Neural Network Lesson

A notebook that is meant to teach people how to understand, design, and create neural networks. Goes over history, forward pass, backpropagation, gradient descent, optimizers, regularization techniques, and hyperparameters, as well as theory.

## Setup
---

Ensure that you have some sort of python and jupyter notebook environment installed. Also make sure you have git installed. You can go [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) to install git.

  - **Step 2**: Navigate to project folder with ```cd yourFolderName```
  - **Step 4**: Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/PatrickErickson4/NeuralNetLesson.git```
  - **Step 5**: Install the dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Starting out
